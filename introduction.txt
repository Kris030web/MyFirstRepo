### Brief Introduction About Myself

My name is Kris. I'm currently learning GitHub as part of my journey into software development.

I enjoy solving problems, learning new technologies, and working on meaningful projects. I'm excited to see what I can build with Git and GitHub!

This is my first repository created as part of a GitHub learning task.
